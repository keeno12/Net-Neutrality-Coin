# Net-Neutrality-Coin
“The Official Coin to Save the Internet” 
Abstract
As Net Neutrality and blockchain technology continue to dominate headlines, cryptocurrencies especially their valuations, and potential to disrupt the financial industry are of increasing interest. However, the average consumer doesn’t understand what a cryptocurrency is or why it matters, let alone how the technology behind it works, including it’s beating heart, a free and open internet. As a result, the public perception of internet application is increasingly narrow minded and short sighted. Likewise, the technology’s potential and long term implications remain esoteric and largely ignored.


1. Mission

We hope through this Modern Day Internet Protest a chance is created to broaden the public’s understanding of technology and its potential applications. We in turn are showing the first use case of how access to our internet is directly linked to cryptocurrency and that cryptocurrency can be used to challenge those in power and fight for the people.

By normalizing the practical application of smart contracts and cryptocurrency transactions, we 
will be able to empower everyday consumers with a basic fluency in distributed ledger technology. Likewise, by showcasing a practical use for blockchain technology outside of the financial industry, we hope to broaden the public’s understanding of the technology and its potential application. We in turn are showing the first use case of how access to our internet is directly linked to cryptocurrency and that cryptocurrency can be used to challenge those in power and fight for the people.

2. Motivation

On December 14th, 2017, a day that will live in infamy, the Federal Communications Commission of the United States ruled in a landmark decision 3-2, declaring the end of a free and open Internet. We are hear to fight back for the people of this great nation who tyrannically having their freedoms taken away.

2.1 Internet and Equality of Opportunity 
The Internet provides the backbone for blockchain technology and is, among other things, a tool for participation in the economy and the political arena. Technology disparities merit policy attention because of the implications for important normative issues such as equality of opportunity, income and wages inequality, and democracy.  The situation of access to Internet has been called “inequality of opportunity” or even worse, “cyberapartheid.” It is necessary for connecting disparate elements of society that we regularly see every day of our lives. The price of unequal Internet access may perpetuate or even widen existing social inequalities.

2.2 Net Neutrality Defined
Net Neutrality is the principle that Internet service providers should enable access to all content and applications regardless of the source, and without favoring or blocking particular products or websites. It is all about sticking up for the little guy and that is what we are hear to do. This determines how corporations and services are regulated; either by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) or the Federal Trades Commission (FTC). If such corporations do create a product from communication services they would be subjected to Title II regulations as is the case of communication providers like Verizon, AT&T, and T-Mobile. In 2005, the US Supreme Court ruled in favor that providing internet as a service was not considered a telecommunications service and therefore it is not within the FCC’s jurisdiction to regulate the possibility of artificial monopolies being created within the Information Technology industries. 


2.3 Freedoms being broken with this ruling
The plan in question, the proposed Restoring Internet Freedom Order, seeks to remove net neutrality protections that were introduced in 2015. These protections sought to ensure that internet service providers (ISPs) like AT&T, Comcast, and TimeWarner treat web content equally and do not block or prioritize some content over others in return for payment. The First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution says, “Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.”

Innovation freedoms are being throttled away from those who can not afford and do not have access. There will be slow lanes of Internet for those in which cannot pay. This means you might have to pay extra money to view and read the information you are seeking. Companies that simply do not have the resources or capital and cannot afford paying these fees to service providers will ultimately fall behind those which can. 


2.4 Solving Problems Through the Blockchain
Techcrunch said, “FCC relating to its handling of the millions of fake comments in its system is a real thing. Congress has repeatedly asked for information on the cybersecurity aspect of this, and New York’s attorney general has gone public with his office’s frustration at being stonewalled by the agency when it comes to identity theft.?” 

2.4.1 Problem 1: Fake Votes and Comments
The blockchain, an immutable public ledger, allows for you to show your support and leave a permanent mark against this ruling, showing you are yourself, and are for Net Neutrality. No more bots, no more fake comments, only you and your voice of truth. 


3. The Token: Net Neutrality Token - (NET)

Token Deployment
Protocol & Limit:
Total Tokens: 350 Million tokens distributed over time by way of crowd sale.
+Any tokens that are not redeemed will be burned following the end of the crowd sale 5/1/2018

Goals of money raised:

- Lobby to the US Congress to repeal this action before their vote to accept this against the FCC.
- Create a modern day Internet Protest by garnering attention and awareness for Net Neutrality and disruptive technologies. 
- Support the people of the United States of America. 

Conclusion:
The FCC’s rushed and technically incorrect proposed Order to abolish net neutrality protections without any replacement is an imminent threat to the Internet we worked so hard to create. The success of America’s startup ecosystem depends on an open internet with enforceable net neutrality rules, ensuring that small companies can compete on a level playing field without the threat that their services will be discriminated against by big cable and wireless companies.
More than 1,000 startups, innovators, investors, and entrepreneurial support organizations from all 50 states have joined Engine, Y Combinator, and Techstars in sending a message to Federal Communications Commission (FCC) Chairman Ajit Pai: Protect Net Neutrality. Don't Leave America's Innovators Behind. Join this modern day Internet Protest and donate to the “The Official Coin to Save the Internet.”
